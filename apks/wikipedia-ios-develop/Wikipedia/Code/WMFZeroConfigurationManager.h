/**
 *  Manages determination of "isZeroRated" state.
 *
 *  Testing notes:
 *
 *  Wikipedia Zero partner data is managed via https://zero.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:ZeroPortal
 *  Special permission is required to access this portal.
 *
 *  Proper testing requires 3 types of connection be available:
 *
 *  - For simulating connecting on a Zero rated carrier's network with Zero rating *enabled*, the SF office's wifi has
 *  a network called WMF-Tester, which is configured with the enabled "TEST1" profile:
 *  https://zero.wikimedia.org/wiki/Zero:TEST1
 *  For this configuration we want to let the user know there will be no data charges.
 *
 *  - For simulating connecting on a Zero rated carrier's network with Zero rating *disabled*, your testing phone's
 *  non-WIFI IP address may be added to the disabled "310-260" profile:
 *  https://zero.wikimedia.org/wiki/Zero:310-260
 *  For this configuration we want to let the user know there will be data charges.
 *  To do this, turn off WIFI on a testing phone and be connected to your cellular carrier's data network - ie via LTE.
 *  Then in Safari browse to Google and enter the search term "IP Address". Copy the IP address and edit
 *  the https://zero.wikimedia.org/wiki/Zero:310-260 configuration page's "ipsets" key changing the "default"
 *  IP address to your device's. Save this change marking it as a minor edit with the a note saying something
 *  like "Updating testing IP". Now you must wait ~15 minutes for your change to propagate.
 *  To determine if a Zero rated carrier's configuration is presently disabled we must fetch "zeroconfig" data and
 *  check for a nil "message".
 *
 *  - Also have a wifi network other than WMF-Tester so you can test connecting as a user NOT on a Zero rated network.
 *  For this configuration we want to let the user know there will be data charges.
 *
 *  See ABaso or MHurd for more information.
