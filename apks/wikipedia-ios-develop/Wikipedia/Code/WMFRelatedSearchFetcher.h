 *  TextExtracts will return HTML truncated as follows (taken from the article on Food Preparation on EN Wikipedia):
 *
   @code
   <p>The following outline is provided as an overview of and a topical guide to food preparation:</p>
   <p><b>Food preparation</b> â€“ preparing food for eating</p>...
   @endcode

 *  Which ends up looking like:
 *
   @code
   The following outline is provided as an overview of and a topical guide to food preparation:
   Food preparation - preparing food for eating
   ...
   @endcode
 *
 *  This poses multiple problems:
 *      - Possibility of double truncation
 *      - Ellipsis appearing on its own line
 *
 *  To circumvent this, it's recommended to request a number of extract characters that will force your
 *  view/label/textview to truncate the string.  For example, adding an extra half or whole line to the number of
 *  characters parameter.
